# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Applying

This repository demonstrates a common issue where Tailwind CSS classes, despite being correctly written and included, may not be applied to HTML elements as expected.

The problem can stem from several sources:

* **Incorrect Configuration:** Ensure the Tailwind CSS configuration file (`tailwind.config.js`) is correctly set up, including content paths and purge options.
* **Missing or Incorrect Imports:** Verify that Tailwind CSS is properly imported into your JavaScript or CSS file(s).
* **CSS Specificity Issues:**  Other CSS rules might be overriding your Tailwind classes due to higher specificity. 
* **Caching Issues:**  Clear your browser's cache and try hard-reloading the page.
* **Typographical Errors:** Double-check class names for any typos.
* **Build Process:** If using a build process (like Webpack or Vite), make sure the build process is correctly configured to include and process your Tailwind CSS.
